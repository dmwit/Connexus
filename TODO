* clicking near the border on connections that extend out of their box
* somehow indicate the boundaries between the pieces / grid spaces
* do something when they win =)
* don't lock off-grid locations
* make it easier to change the size of the grid
* keyboard bindings
* non-idiot mode: don't face edges outside
* countably infinite puzzle
* pipe dream mode
* make drag require Ctrl or something so that middle-click is less annoying
* wrapping/klein bottle mode
* two-sided puzzle with links from one layer to the other or something
* scrap StrokeSet in favor of taking advantage of Cairo's built-in stroke-merging
* muck with the "Detail" section of the documentation for Graphics.UI.Gtk.OpenGL (currently it consists of the text "A typical program will look like this", and nothing more)
* change the order for constraint solving: outside-in, but squares with only one solution sort last
* timer + rotation countdown + new-game dialog
* play with pushGroup/popGroupToSource/whateverTheWithGroupSurfaceThingIs rather than StrokeSet
